    <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>After years of working in the Blue Collar industry, I decided a change was needed in order to spend more time at home with my family. My best friend inspired me to take up coding. Since then, I have hit the ground running. I look forward to seeing where this journey takes me, and the opportunities it creates for my family.</p>
